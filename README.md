# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying in Vue.js
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS in a Vue.js application. The issue arises during the build process, where Tailwind fails to apply certain utility classes correctly.

## Bug Description
Styles defined with Tailwind directives are missing from the rendered application after building. The build process seems to ignore or misinterpret these classes.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Observe the missing styles in the built application.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the correct integration between Tailwind CSS and Vue.js's build process.  This may include verifying the correct configuration of the `tailwind.config.js` file, ensuring that the Tailwind directives are correctly applied within the Vue components, and properly integrating with the build tools.
