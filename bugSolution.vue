The solution typically involves several steps to ensure correct configuration:

1. **Verify `tailwind.config.js`:** Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` file correctly includes your project's content and specifies the correct paths:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

2. **Correctly apply classes:** Ensure you are correctly using Tailwind classes within your Vue components. Check for typos or inconsistencies.  Here is an example:
```vue
<template>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Click Me
  </div>
</template>
```

3. **Build Process Integration:** Correct integration with your build process is crucial.  For Vue CLI, make sure you've followed the official Tailwind CSS integration guide correctly.

4. **Purge CSS:** If the build is too large, you might have to purge unused CSS.

By addressing these points, the missing styles issue should be resolved.
